# Header & Footer
# Ticks start from 0, so anything below 0 OR not a number will be ignored
# Delay-after-turn means after all the ticks has finished.
# How many ticks to wait, until the next turn of ticks.
# An empty section (represented as '{}') can be created to not put header or footer

# Fake ping allows 'randomize' or 'constant', e.g randomize, value: '1-500', constant: '3'
# Optional param for 'randomize' is 'ping-update', which states every X ticks to update the ping
