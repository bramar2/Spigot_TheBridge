# Scoreboard File Configuration
#
# Ticks start from 0, so anything below 0 OR not a number will be ignored
# Format for each tick:
# - '{TITLE}'
# - '{this is ignored}'
# - 'Content Line 1'
# - 'Content Line 2'
#
# Delay-after-turn means after all the ticks has finished.
# How many ticks to wait, until the next turn of ticks.
# delay-after-turn: 50
# In this case (with 1 tick of only '0'), the scoreboard will update every 10 ticks/0.5 seconds
# --- THIS IS A BASIC SCOREBOARD. FLICKERS AND INCONSISTENCIES MIGHT AND PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN!               ---
# --- THIS SCOREBOARD WILL NEVER BE UPDATED EXCEPT FOR BUGS! USE A SUPPORTED BOARD PLUGIN FOR BETTER RESULTS ---
